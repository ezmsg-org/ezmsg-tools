TODO:
In Spectrogram, the Window unit creates a new `step` axis that has offset=time_of_first_samp_in_window.
Then, the Spectrum Unit destroys the original time axis so we lost knowledge that the Spectrogram output
actually represents data from offset to offset + window length.

The Decoder feeds a lagged history of the feature data to the decoder. The output's time axis' offset will be
the time of the oldest feature, which is the oldest spectrum. So a 500 msec spectrum means the feature-sample
is already 500 msec old, and a 200 msec lagged feature window yields an offset that is an additional 200 msec old.
Is that right?
